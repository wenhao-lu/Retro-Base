## Customized WordPress Functions

### New Theme

A custom theme has been created specifically for Retro Base. 

### Handheld Plugin

A custom plugin named 'Handheld-Data-Management' has been developed to handle a new data table and a custom data type different from default post types. Admin users can perform CRUD operations in the CMS. 

### Notes Plugin

Another plugin, 'Notes', has been created to handle a custom post type for registered user CRUD interactions. A front page has been designed specifically for managing notes, allowing users to perform CRUD operations without accessing the CMS.

Feel free to explore the website, manage content through the dashboard, and enjoy the Retro Base experience!
